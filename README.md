# Recipe Manager

## Project Scope

Recipe Manager is a full-stack web application designed to help users **store**, **categorize**, **filter**, and **share** their favorite recipes. The platform enables both private and public sharing of recipes, including anonymous submissions, all within a clean and accessible interface.

### Key Goals:
- Provide a seamless way for users to upload, edit, and view recipes.
- Offer advanced filter and tag-based browsing (e.g., vegan, spicy, gluten-free).
- Support image uploads, step-by-step instructions, and dietary labels.
- Enable anonymous public sharing while protecting user data and privacy.
